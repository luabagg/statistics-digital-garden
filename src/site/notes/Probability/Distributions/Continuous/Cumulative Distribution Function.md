# Cumulative Distribution Function

Compact study note.

## Summary

The cumulative distribution function gives probability that random variable values are at or below chosen thresholds. Every real-valued random variable has a CDF.[^openstax-continuous]

## Prerequisites

- [[Probability/Random Variable/Random Variable\|Random Variable]]

## Notation and Assumptions

$F_X(x)=P(X\le x)$ for all real $x$. CDFs are nondecreasing, right-continuous, and have limits $0$ at $-\infty$ and $1$ at $+\infty$.

## Essential Result

For continuous variables, interval probability is CDF difference:

$$P(l<X\le u)=F_X(u)-F_X(l).$$

For discrete variables, jump sizes give point probabilities.

## Small Example

If $X$ is uniform on $[0,1]$, then $F_X(0.3)=0.3$.

## Common Mistakes

- Assuming every CDF is continuous; discrete CDFs jump.
- Using $F_X(b)-F_X(a)$ with wrong endpoint conventions for atoms.
