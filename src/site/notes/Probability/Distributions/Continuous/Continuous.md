# Continuous Distributions

Compact study note.

## Summary

Continuous distributions assign probability through areas under density curves. They model measurements, waiting times, positive quantities, and sampling distributions.[^openstax-continuous]

## Prerequisites

- [[Probability/Random Variable/Continuous Random Variable\|Continuous Random Variable]]

## Notation and Assumptions

Use $f_X(x)$ for PDF and $F_X(x)$ for CDF. Total density must satisfy

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f_X(x)\,dx=1.$$

## Essential Result

Support and parameterization are part of the definition; the same distribution name can have rate or scale forms.

## Small Example

An exponential waiting time with rate $\lambda$ has support $[0,\infty)$ and density $\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating density height like probability.
- Forgetting support restrictions including $x>0$ for gamma, log-normal, chi-square, and F distributions.
