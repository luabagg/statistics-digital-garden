# Central Limit Theorem

Compact study note.

## Summary

The central limit theorem explains why normalized sums and averages are often approximately normal, even when individual observations are not normal.[^mit-prob]

## Prerequisites

- [[Probability/IID Random Variables\|IID Random Variables]]
- [[Probability/Distributions/Continuous/Normal Distribution\|Normal Distribution]]

## Notation and Assumptions

For IID $X_i$ with mean $\mu$ and variance $0<\sigma^2<\infty$, $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^nX_i-n\mu}{\sigma\sqrt n}$ converges in distribution to $N(0,1)$.

## Essential Result

Equivalently, $\bar X_n$ is approximately $N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$ for large $n$ under the theorem assumptions.

## Small Example

For many independent Bernoulli trials with success probability $p$, the sample proportion is approximately normal with mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)/n$ when $n$ is large enough.

## Common Mistakes

- Applying the CLT to strongly dependent data without justification.
- Forgetting that the approximation is about normalized sums, not raw observations.
