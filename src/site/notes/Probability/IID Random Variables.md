# IID Random Variables

Compact study note.

## Summary

IID means random variables are independent and share the same distribution. This assumption powers sample means, laws of large numbers, and the central limit theorem.[^mit-prob]

## Prerequisites

- [[Probability/Independence\|Independence]]
- [[Probability/Random Variable/Random Variable\|Random Variable]]

## Notation and Assumptions

$X_1,\ldots,X_n$ are IID when they are mutually independent and each $X_i$ has the same distribution.

## Essential Result

For IID variables with finite mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, $E[\bar X_n]=\mu$ and $\operatorname{Var}(\bar X_n)=\sigma^2/n$.

## Small Example

Repeated fair die rolls are IID if the die is rolled under identical conditions and previous rolls do not influence later rolls.

## Common Mistakes

- Checking identical distribution but forgetting independence.
- Assuming time-ordered data are IID without checking dependence or drift.
