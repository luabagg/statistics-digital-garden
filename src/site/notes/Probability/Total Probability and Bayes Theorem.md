# Total Probability and Bayes' Theorem

Compact study note.

## Summary

The law of total probability decomposes events across partitions. Bayes' theorem reverses conditional probability by combining likelihood with prior probabilities.[^openstax-prob]

## Prerequisites

- [[Probability/Conditional Probability\|Conditional Probability]]

## Notation and Assumptions

Let $B_1,\ldots,B_n$ be disjoint events with positive probability and union $\Omega$. Then

$$P(A)=\sum_i P(A\mid B_i)P(B_i).$$

## Essential Result

Bayes' theorem, whenever $P(A)>0$:

$$P(B_j\mid A)=\frac{P(A\mid B_j)P(B_j)}{\sum_i P(A\mid B_i)P(B_i)}.$$

## Small Example

If a test is positive with probability $0.9$ for disease and $0.05$ without disease, and prevalence is $0.01$, then $P(D\mid +)=0.009/(0.009+0.0495)\approx0.154$.

## Common Mistakes

- Ignoring base rates.
- Using Bayes' theorem when conditioning events do not form partition.
