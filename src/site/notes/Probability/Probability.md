# Probability

Compact study note.

## Summary

Probability assigns coherent numerical weights to uncertain events. Modern probability starts with sample space, event sigma-algebra, and probability measure.[^mit-prob]

## Prerequisites

- Prerequisites: None

## Notation and Assumptions

Use $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)$ for probability space notation: outcomes live in $\Omega$, events live in $\mathcal{F}$, and $P$ maps events to numbers in $[0,1]$.

## Essential Result

The core workflow is: define outcomes, choose measurable events, assign probabilities, then study random variables and distributions derived from those events.

## Small Example

For fair die roll, $\Omega=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ and $P(\{2,4,6\})=3/6=1/2$ for event 'even result'.

## Common Mistakes

- Treating outcome $3$ and event $\{3\}$ as identical objects.
- Using formulas before checking the event belongs to the chosen sigma-algebra.
