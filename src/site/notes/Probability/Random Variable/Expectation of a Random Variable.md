# Expected Value

Compact study note.

## Summary

Expected value is the probability-weighted average of a random variable when the required sum or integral is finite. It is linear even when variables are dependent.[^openstax-discrete]

## Prerequisites

- [[Probability/Random Variable/Random Variable\|Random Variable]]

## Notation and Assumptions

Discrete expectation:

$$E[X]=\sum_x xP(X=x).$$

Continuous expectation with density $f_X$:

$$E[X]=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x f_X(x)\,dx.$$

Use these formulas when the absolute sum or integral is finite.

## Essential Result

Linearity: $E[aX+bY+c]=aE[X]+bE[Y]+c$ whenever the expectations exist.

## Small Example

If $X$ counts heads in two fair flips, $E[X]=0(1/4)+1(1/2)+2(1/4)=1$.

## Common Mistakes

- Averaging possible values without probability weights.
- Assuming expectation exists for every distribution.
