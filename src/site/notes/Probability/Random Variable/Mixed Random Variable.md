# Mixed Random Variable

Compact study note.

## Summary

Mixed random variable has both point masses and continuous component. Its distribution is not described completely by only PMF or only PDF.[^mit-prob]

## Prerequisites

- [[Variável Aleatória\|Random Variable]]
- [[Variável Aleatória Discreta\|Discrete Random Variable]]
- [[Variável Aleatória Contínua\|Continuous Random Variable]]

## Notation and Assumptions

A CDF $F_X$ is mixed when it has jumps at some points and continuous growth over intervals. Jump size at point $c$ equals $P(X=c)$.

## Essential Result

Compute probabilities by adding point masses and integrating the density over the continuous part.

## Small Example

Let $P(X=0)=0.3$ and, conditional on not being zero, $X$ be uniform on $(0,1)$ with weight $0.7$. Then $P(X\le0.5)=0.3+0.7(0.5)=0.65$.

## Common Mistakes

- Representing the continuous component with an impossible atom at infinity.
- Dropping the point mass when computing expectations.

## Connections

- [[Função de Distribuição Acumulada\|Cumulative Distribution Function]]
