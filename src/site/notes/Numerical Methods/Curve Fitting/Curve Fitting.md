# Curve Fitting

## Summary

Curve fitting chooses a model family and parameters that match data in an approximate sense. Least squares is the default criterion when errors are roughly additive and isotropic.

## Prerequisites

[[Linear Algebra/Linear Algebra\|Linear Algebra]], [[Numerical Methods/Curve Fitting/Least Squares\|Least Squares]]

## Learning Order

1. [[Numerical Methods/Curve Fitting/Least Squares\|Least Squares]] — linear regression / polynomial models linear in parameters
2. Cross-link theory: [[Linear Algebra/Least Squares and QR\|Least Squares and QR]]
3. Related interpolation (exact through nodes): [[Numerical Methods/Polynomial Interpolation/Polynomial Interpolation\|Polynomial Interpolation]]

## Key Distinctions

- **Interpolation** forces $P(x_i)=y_i$ exactly.
- **Fitting / regression** allows residual $y_i-f(x_i)\neq 0$ and minimizes a loss.
- A model can be nonlinear in $x$ yet linear in parameters (e.g. $a+bx+cx^2$).

## Worked Example Pointer

For $(1,2),(2,3),(3,5)$, the OLS line is $y=\frac13+\frac32 x$. Details in [[Numerical Methods/Curve Fitting/Least Squares\|Least Squares]].
