# Existence and Uniqueness of the Interpolating Polynomial

## Summary

Through $n+1$ points with distinct abscissae there exists exactly one polynomial of degree at most $n$ that interpolates them.

## Prerequisites

[[Pre-Calculus/Polynomials and Rational Functions/Polynomials and Rational Functions\|Polynomials and Rational Functions]]

## Statement

Let $(x_0,y_0),\ldots,(x_n,y_n)$ with $x_i\neq x_j$ for $i\neq j$. There exists a unique $P\in\mathbb{R}[x]$ with $\deg P\le n$ such that $P(x_i)=y_i$ for all $i$.

## Proof Sketch

**Uniqueness.** If $P$ and $Q$ both interpolate, then $R=P-Q$ has degree $\le n$ and $n+1$ roots, so $R\equiv 0$.

**Existence.** The Lagrange formula

$$
P(x)=\sum_{i=0}^n y_i\prod_{j\neq i}\frac{x-x_j}{x_i-x_j}
$$

is a polynomial of degree $\le n$ that hits every node.
