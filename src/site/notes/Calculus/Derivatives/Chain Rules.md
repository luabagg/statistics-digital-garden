# Chain Rule

## Summary

The chain rule differentiates compositions. In several variables it multiplies Jacobian factors along each path of dependence.

## Prerequisites

[[Calculus/Derivatives/Derivatives\|Derivatives]], [[Calculus/Derivatives/Partial Derivatives\|Partial Derivatives]]

## Main Result / Formula

### One variable

If $y=f(u)$ and $u=g(x)$, then

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(u)\,g'(x).
$$

### Two variables, one independent

If $z=f(x,y)$ and $x=x(t)$, $y=y(t)$, then

$$
\frac{dz}{dt}=f_x\frac{dx}{dt}+f_y\frac{dy}{dt}.
$$

Special case $z=f(x,y)$ with $x=g(y)$:

$$
\frac{dz}{dy}=f_x(g(y),y)\,g'(y)+f_y(g(y),y).
$$

### Implicit differentiation form

If $F(x,y)=c$ defines $y=y(x)$ with $F_y\neq 0$, then

$$
\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{F_x}{F_y}.
$$

This is **not** a formula for $\partial z/\partial y$ of an unconstrained $z=f(x,y)$.

## Worked Example

Let $z=x^2+y^2$ and $x=t$, $y=t^2$. Then

$$
\frac{dz}{dt}=2x\cdot 1+2y\cdot 2t=2t+4t^3.
$$

## Common Mistakes

- Writing $\partial z/\partial y=(\partial z/\partial x)(\partial x/\partial y)$ and dropping the direct $f_y$ term.
- Mixing the implicit formula $-F_x/F_y$ into unconstrained partial derivatives.
