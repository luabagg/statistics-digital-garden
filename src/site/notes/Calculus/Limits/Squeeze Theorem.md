# Squeeze Theorem

## Summary

The squeeze theorem (sandwich theorem) finds a limit by trapping a function between two others that share the same limit.

## Prerequisites

[[Calculus/Limits/Limits\|Limits]]

## Definition / Theorem

Suppose $g(x)\le f(x)\le h(x)$ for all $x$ in a deleted neighborhood of $a$. If

$$
\lim_{x\to a}g(x)=\lim_{x\to a}h(x)=L,
$$

then

$$
\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L.
$$

The same idea works for one-sided limits and for $x\to\pm\infty$.

## Conditions / Assumptions

- The inequality must hold near the limit point (except possibly at the point itself).
- Both bounding functions must share **the same** finite (or infinite) limit. One bound alone is not enough.

## Worked Example

Because $-1\le\sin(1/x)\le 1$ for $x\neq 0$,

$$
-|x|\le x\sin(1/x)\le |x|.
$$

Since $\lim_{x\to 0}(-|x|)=\lim_{x\to 0}|x|=0$, the squeeze theorem gives

$$
\lim_{x\to 0}x\sin(1/x)=0.
$$

## Common Mistakes

- Using only an upper bound (for example $0<e^{-x^2}<x^4$) and concluding a wrong limit. In fact $\lim_{x\to\infty}e^{-x^2}=0$.
- Applying the theorem when the two bounds have different limits.
