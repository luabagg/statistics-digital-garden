# np Chart

An np chart monitors the number of nonconforming units in samples of constant size. It is the count-scale companion to the p chart.[^montgomery-np]

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites: binomial distribution and p chart logic.

## Process Context

Use an np chart when each sample has the same inspected size \(n\) and the audience should see counts rather than proportions.

## Definition

For sample \(i\), plot \(D_i\), the number of nonconforming units. Under stable conditions, \(D_i\) is modeled as binomial with parameters \(n\) and \(p\).

## Assumptions / Requirements

- Fixed sample size \(n\).
- Each unit has two possible classifications.
- Unit classifications are independent.
- The probability \(p\) is stable when only common causes are present.

## Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| \(D_i\) | Nonconforming units in sample \(i\) |
| \(n\) | Fixed inspected sample size |
| \(\bar{p}\) | Pooled estimate of fraction nonconforming |

## Control Limits / Formula

$$
CL_{np}=n\bar{p}
$$

$$
UCL_{np}=n\bar{p}+3\sqrt{n\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}
$$

$$
LCL_{np}=\max\left(0,n\bar{p}-3\sqrt{n\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}\right).
$$

## Interpretation Rules

- A high point signals more nonconforming units than expected from stable variation.
- Low points can signal improvement or changed inspection/classification.
- If sample size varies, use a p chart instead.

## Worked Example

Five samples of \(n=100\) units have nonconforming counts \(4,7,5,6,8\). The pooled estimate is \(\bar{p}=0.06\), so \(CL=6\).

$$
UCL=6+3\sqrt{100(0.06)(0.94)}=13.13
$$

$$
LCL=\max(0,6-7.13)=0.
$$

All five counts are within the chart limits.

## Common Mistakes

- Using an np chart when sample sizes vary.
- Plotting defects instead of nonconforming units.
- Forgetting that one nonconforming unit may contain many defects.
- Replacing control limits with accept/reject specifications.
