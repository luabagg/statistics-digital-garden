# p Chart

A p chart monitors sample proportions of nonconforming units.
It charts units classified conforming or nonconforming.[^nist-p-chart]

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites: binomial distribution and control chart basics.

## Process Context

Use p charts when each inspected unit is counted once as conforming or nonconforming.
Sample sizes may vary.

## Definition

For sample $i$, let $D_i$ be the number of nonconforming units and $n_i$ the number inspected. The plotted statistic is:

$$
\hat{p}_i = \frac{D_i}{n_i}.
$$

## Assumptions / Requirements

- Each unit is classified into one of two outcomes.
- Units are independent within and between samples.
- The probability of nonconformance is stable when only common causes are present.
- Sample sizes are large enough for normal-approximation limits to be useful, or exact/binomial methods are considered.

## Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $D_i$ | Nonconforming units in sample $i$ |
| $n_i$ | Inspected units in sample $i$ |
| $\hat{p}_i$ | Sample proportion nonconforming |
| $\bar{p}$ | Pooled estimate of process fraction nonconforming |

## Control Limits / Formula

Estimate:

$$
\bar{p}=\frac{\sum_i D_i}{\sum_i n_i}.
$$

For sample $i$:

$$
UCL_i=\bar{p}+3\sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}{n_i}}
$$

$$
CL=\bar{p}
$$

$$
LCL_i=\max\left(0,\bar{p}-3\sqrt{\frac{\bar{p}(1-\bar{p})}{n_i}}\right).
$$

## Interpretation Rules

- Points above the UCL suggest a worse-than-stable nonconforming rate.
- Points below the LCL can signal improvement, inspection changes, or classification changes.
- Variable $n_i$ means variable limits.
- If $n_i$ is fixed and counts are easier to communicate, an np chart is equivalent.

## Worked Example

Five samples of 100 units have nonconforming counts $4,7,5,6,8$. Then $\bar{p}=30/500=0.06$.

$$
UCL=0.06+3\sqrt{\frac{0.06(0.94)}{100}}=0.1313
$$

$$
LCL=\max(0,0.06-0.0713)=0.
$$

The observed proportions $0.04,0.07,0.05,0.06,0.08$ are inside the limits.

## Common Mistakes

- Using a p chart for number of defects; use c or u charts for defects.
- Forgetting that changing sample size changes the limits.
- Treating "defective" and "nonconforming" as identical in all contexts.
- Using specification limits as control limits.
