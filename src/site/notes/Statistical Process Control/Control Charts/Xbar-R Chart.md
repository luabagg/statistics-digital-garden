# Xbar-R Chart

An Xbar-R chart monitors a variable process characteristic using rational subgroups. The Xbar chart monitors subgroup means, and the R chart monitors subgroup ranges.[^nist-xbar-r]

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites: control chart basics and rational subgrouping.

## Process Context

Use Xbar-R when each plotted point summarizes a small subgroup, commonly 2 to 10 observations, collected close enough in time that within-subgroup variation represents short-term common-cause variation.

## Definition

For subgroup $i$ with size $n$, the subgroup mean is $\bar{x}_i$ and the subgroup range is $R_i = x_{i,\max} - x_{i,\min}$. The chart pair is interpreted together: first check the R chart for stable short-term variation, then interpret the Xbar chart.

## Assumptions / Requirements

- Variable measurement data.
- Same subgroup size for the constants shown below.
- Independent subgroups in time.
- Approximate normality is most important for small-sample probability interpretation.
- Rational subgrouping is defensible.

## Notation

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| $n$ | Subgroup size |
| $\bar{x}_i$ | Mean of subgroup $i$ |
| $R_i$ | Range of subgroup $i$ |
| $\bar{\bar{x}}$ | Average of subgroup means |
| $\bar{R}$ | Average of subgroup ranges |
| $A_2,D_3,D_4$ | Control chart constants based on $n$ |

## Control Limits / Formula

For equal subgroup size:

$$
\begin{aligned}
UCL_{\bar{X}} &= \bar{\bar{x}} + A_2\bar{R}, &
CL_{\bar{X}} &= \bar{\bar{x}}, &
LCL_{\bar{X}} &= \bar{\bar{x}} - A_2\bar{R}, \\
UCL_R &= D_4\bar{R}, &
CL_R &= \bar{R}, &
LCL_R &= D_3\bar{R}.
\end{aligned}
$$

For $n=5$, common constants are $A_2=0.577$, $D_3=0$, and $D_4=2.115$.[^nist-xbar-r]

## Interpretation Rules

- Investigate any point outside control limits.
- Investigate nonrandom patterns, especially runs, trends, or cycles.
- If the R chart is unstable, never interpret Xbar shifts like stable mean behavior.
- Do not compare points to specification limits on the control chart.

## Worked Example

Four subgroups of size $n=5$ have means $10.02, 9.98, 10.05, 10.00$ and ranges $0.12, 0.15, 0.10, 0.13$. Then $\bar{\bar{x}}=10.0125$ and $\bar{R}=0.125$.

$$
UCL_{\bar{X}}=10.0125+0.577(0.125)=10.0846
$$

$$
LCL_{\bar{X}}=10.0125-0.577(0.125)=9.9404
$$

$$
UCL_R=2.115(0.125)=0.2644,\qquad LCL_R=0.
$$

All listed subgroup means and ranges are inside these limits, so this small example shows no control-limit signal.

## Common Mistakes

- Using Xbar-R for one observation at a time.
- Ignoring the R chart and interpreting only the Xbar chart.
- Forming subgroups from mixed machines, shifts, or materials when the goal is short-term variation.
- Using specification limits as the Xbar chart limits.
